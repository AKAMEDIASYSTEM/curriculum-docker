            <p>Curriculum is a tool for small, creative groups - about 4 to 8 people is the best size. It works by accumulating fragments of your group's HTTP browsing (Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, etc) and making them into a stream that only your group can see.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's a group feed. No one person can be traced back to any particular term you see.</li>
                <li>It's HTTP-only, no HTTPS. That means it doesn't look at Facebook, Twitter, banking sites, most shopping sites, etc.</li>
                <li>It's ephemeral&mdash;everything is permanently deleted after 28 days. Curriculum is about a stream of ideas you and your colleagues are encountering, it's not designed for any kind of analysis.</li>
                <li>It's open-source. You can read every line of the <a href="https://github.com/AKAMEDIASYSTEM/curriculum-docker">code</a> and make sure it's doing what you want.</li>
            </ul>
